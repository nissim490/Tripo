## Software description  
There is a lot of information about trip locations over the internet. Sometimes the user can’t determine if this information is written by a location visitor or an expert advertiser.
The internet changes all the culture of trip planning. In the past, tourist contact with a travel agent to plan trips. The agent has a significant impact on the tourist experience because he should match the trip plan to their expectation. Unfortunately, travel agent recommendation could be tended, because of foreign considerations such as money profit, personal relations, colleagues, etc. 
Nowadays, travelers plan their trip decisions based on internet platforms and sites, such as Instagram, trips blogs, travel aggregator websites, and travel metasearch engines. The information that is published over the internet could be a personal experience or promotion. In most cases, the regular traveler obtains a huge amount of probably irrelevant or unreliable information. This previous knowledge has extremely effects on the reader's perspective. Personal experience is more honest and helps the readers to plan travels without any external foreign considerations.
Our mission was to help travelers to ignore promotion reviews over the internet. Honest reviews can save money and prevent redundant disappointment. We believe that our research is the first step in this direction. This approach can be implemented for many kinds of areas and not just for a traveler’s reviews, rather any text review we wish to check. 
We analyzed text trip reviews and determined the degree of interest relates to the users. The project aims were to develop a tool that gives the users a text classification prediction that represents the possibility of promotion of products or traveler personal review. The prediction was based on score units. Each unit represented a different approach. Eventually, we built from those units an Object vector and used the KNN algorithm to find the best text classification matching. In this project, we used the following approaches: Sentiment analysis, Content dictionary.
